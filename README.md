# Progression
The goal of this module is to go through the patches of Wrath of the Lich King. More information on what is new in each patch can be seen by browsing into the corresponding folder.

I am currently limiting this to Wrath of the Lich King so that I can get it to the point where it could be considered ready for production. I might be adding The Burning Crusade afterwards followed by Vanilla.
