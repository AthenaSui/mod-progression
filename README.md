# Progression
The goal of this module is to go through the patches of Wrath of the Lich King. The included patches are 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.3.5. Every patch includes changes to simulate that patch as best as possible. Information on what is new in each patch can be seen by browsing their folder, although there are probably things listed that aren't implemented yet.

# Note
Keep in mind that it's not complete even if there seems to be a lot done. It's not meant to be 1:1 compared to retail Wrath of the Lich King because with changes to spells and so forth that's impossible without client and core edits, and those kind of edits are not what I want.

# Corrections
Create issue reports for anything that isn't correct and I will look into it as soon as I have the time to. If something isn't intended to be in a certain patch, or if it is, I want to change it and would greatly appreciate reports for it.

The same can be said for improvements to the code. I'm not a professional developer in any way so it might not be clean or very optimized and therefore I welcome suggestions for that too.
