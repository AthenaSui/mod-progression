# Progression
The goal of this module is to go through the patches of Wrath of the Lich King. More information on what is new in each patch can be seen by browsing their folder. The included patches are 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.3.5 and each one includes changes to simulate the corresponding patch.

I am currently limiting this to Wrath of the Lich King so that I can get it to the point where I would consider it to be ready for production. I might be adding The Burning Crusade afterwards followed by Vanilla, only time will tell.
